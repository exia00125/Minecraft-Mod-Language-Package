guide.skyresources.compression.compression.title=Compression - Compress all the things!
guide.skyresources.compression.compression.text=You are able to compress your blocks such as stone into more compact blocks like <recipe,,sc:compressedstone:0> . \n \n These blocks yield more dirty gems and stone dust than their regular variants, but can only be harvested with a <recipe,,sc:compressedrockgrinder:0> .

guide.skyresources.compression.compressedwaterextracting.title=Compression - Water extraction
guide.skyresources.compression.compressedwaterextracting.text=With the <recipe,,sc:compressedwaterextractor:0> you can extract water from up to 27 blocks at once (excluding water source blocks)! This device will extract in a 3x3x3 radius around the block you are currently looking at. \n \n Please note that this device will only extract from one source at a time. Extracting from a cactus and leaves at the same time will not work. \n \n You can also use this to inject <recipe,,sc:compresseddirt:0> with 1800mB of water to turn it into <recipe,,sc:compressedclay:0> .

guide.skyresources.compression.compressedCactus.title=Compression - Cactus Needles
guide.skyresources.compression.compressedCactus.text=Shift right clicking a <recipe,,sc:compressedcactus:0> will yield you 9 <recipe,,skyresources:alchemyitemcomponent:0> . It will also do serious damage to you, so be careful with this powerful plant.

guide.skyresources.compression.compressedAutomation.title=Compression - Automation
guide.skyresources.compression.compressedAutomation.text=Just like normal blocks, compressed blocks can be automatically crushed and cleaned. This will be done by using the <recipe,,sc:compressedrockcrusher:0> and the |WIP compressed rock cleaner|. These machines work the same as their normal counterparts, but consume more energy and process a bit faster.
