pe.manual.pe_alchemical_bag=A practicing alchemist like yourself has no time to constantly pick up and place down Alchemical Chests for storage. By sprinkling High power Covalence Dust on an alchemical chest and wrapping it in cloth, one can shrink the chest down to the size of a pouch. The bag has all the capacity of the chest. Curiously, the bags seem to be bound to some metaphysical network, as all bags of the same color seem to contain the same items, regardless of if the bag was yours or your neighbor's. The bag also seems to activate magical items the same way the chest does.
pe.manual.pe_philosophers_stone=For centuries legends have been spread about the Philosopher's Stone and its powers. Transmutation without circles, immortality, all of the riches one could desire, and more are said to be within the wielders power. While it may forever be lost to time, modern alchemists have discovered the secret to synthesizing a suitable replacement for some of the more basic powers. Be warned however as those who have succeeded in its creation often have a new look in their eyes, bringing with them tales of fire and demons.
pe.manual.pe_repair_talisman=Covalence Dust may be a cure-all for tool wear and tear, however manually rubbing it over knicks and dings can get tedious fast. Enter the Repair Talisman, by wrapping up the three colors of Covalence Dust in a tight bundle it can be distributed gradually over the tools in your bag, allowing you to tend to your sheep and perform other tasks of utmost importance.
pe.manual.pe_fuel_block_2=Like other solid fuels Aeternalis can be compressed into block form. Stylish and efficient.
pe.manual.pe_alchemy_chest=It is no secret that alchemists like shiny things, a desire for endless gold comes with the territory, but normal storage solutions do not live up to these demands. Enter the Alchemical Chest which can store 104 item stacks, at the cost of one shiny and some Covalence Dust you can store practically endless shinies.
pe.manual.pe_fuel_block_0=Like other solid fuels Mobius Fuel can be compressed into block form. Use it as a efficient fuel, or a poor mans Red Matter for decor.
pe.manual.pe_relay_MK1=Relays are your one stop shop for providing EMC to a Condensers and other alchemical devices, simply attach it to the side of one and away you go. EMC can be provided by raw materials, or by an attached Collector. ToDo merge pages.
pe.manual.pe_dm_block=Raw Dark and Red Matter can be formed into a block, not only can it be used as high class decor in this form, but also as a key material for a number of alchemical devices. ToDo merge pages.
pe.manual.pe_dm_furnace=Matter furnaces are powerful alchemical devices which can be powered by a EMC source such as a Relay or Collector. They are well known for efficiency due to both their speed, and their ability to automatically output to a nearby chest. ToDo merge pages.
pe.manual.pe_collector_MK1=Collectors are some of the most controversial alchemical devices due to their ability to generate EMC using nothing more than a light source. This EMC can be transfered to an attached device such as a Relay or Condenser, or used by the collector itself to charge a alchemical item such as a Klein Star. One can also use a collector to transform raw fuel materials into more powerful ones. ToDo merge pages.
pe.manual.pe_condenser=Transmutation Tables are great for turning one thing into another, however the process is manual and not fit for automation. Condensers are the solution to this problem, simply set a item as the target and anything dumped into it will be transmuted into the target. The target can also be created from EMC provided by a attached device such as a Relay or Collector.
pe.manual.pe_condenser_mk2=The Energy Condenser MK2 has all the features of the MK1, but splits the inventory to have a separate input and output.
pe.manual.pe_interdiction_torch=The Interdiction Torch is more than just a stylish alternative to coal and twigs, any mob that approaches it will be pushed away, as a wise man once said... NONE SHALL PASS! 
pe.manual.pe_fuel_block_0=Like other solid fuels Mobius Fuel can be compressed into block form. Use it as a efficient fuel, or a poor mans Red Matter for decor.
pe.manual.pe_nova_cataclysm=All the fun of the Nova Catalyst, but with double the boom!
pe.manual.pe_nova_catalyst=The Nova Catalyst is a powerful alchemical explosive, it causes quite the boom with the added benefit of preserving the nearby blocks for pickup.
pe.manual.pe_transmutation_stone=The Transmutation Table allows the alchemist to study the makeup of materials, and break down others to create more of them. Dirt goes in, Diamonds come out!
pe.manual.introduction=By opening this book you have taken the first steps on your journey to become a High Alchemist. Perhaps you are weary of performing the same grindy tasks over and over, or you simply desire more power for... purposes, or you'd like the utility and art of magic at your disposal. Regardless, alchemy is sure to fit your needs. Before you can begin however it is important to understand the past...    The art of alchemy has been known since ancient times. It was discovered by a man known as x3n0ph0b3, and refined through multiple iterations. After x3n0ph0b3's retirement, a new apprentice, Pahimar, took up development of the art, but many alchemists were displeased by his new methods, a war broke out between the two sides with strange audible chants akin to "lazy cheaters" and "EE2 OP!!!!!!" filling the air. x3n0's followers thought all was lost until a wander by the name of MozeIntel led them underground, he had studied and reproduced x3n0's work, thus the old art lived on. Eventually, for reasons unknown (reasons he strangely described as "IRL"), Moze retired, leaving his work to an eager apprentice, SinkillerJ. Sin went on to not only bring peace to the two sides allowing them to coexist, but to also form a council of alchemists dedicated to the preservation of the old art:    Williewillus - Lord of Refactors    Blubberbub - Alchemical Value Archivist    Lilylicious - Lady of Little Big Things    We, the council of alchemists, now impart upon you our most extensive knowledge of the alchemical arts, and welcome you, young alchemist, to the world of ProjectE.
