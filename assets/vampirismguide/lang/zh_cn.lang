guide.vampirism.overview.config.general.examples=§lNoticeable Examples:§r\n§oSundamage Dimensions§r\nYou can set a default for unspecified dimension (sundamage_default). You can specify sundamage for a dimension by adding "<dim>:<1/0>" to sundamge_dims (e.g. "5:1" to enable sundamage in dim 5). Use one line/String for each dimension. You can find out the dimension you are in game with "/vampirism currentDimension".\n§oAuto convert glass bottles$r\n By default Vampirism automatically converts between blood bottles and glas bottles depending on what is needed right now. If you do not want this or it causes problems with another mod, you can disable it.
guide.vampirism.vampire.leveling.inspiration.text=Craft Altar of Inspiration and place it somewhere. To use this one you have to fill it with blood (right-click with filled blood bottles). If there is enough blood inside you can right-click with an empty hand and the blood will be infused into you, making you even stronger.
guide.vampirism.vampire.leveling.infusion.intro=This altar requires a multiblock structure. First craft the main block (%s) and place it down, then build %s around it and fill them with special blocks by right clicking a pillar. Place a %s at the top of each pillar. The pillar count as well as the required pillar filling depends on the level (more information below). After the structure is complete, put the required amount of items into the altar, right click with an empty hand and wait for the magic to happen.
guide.vampirism.blocks.castle_block.text=Decorative block. Prevents non vampire mobs from spawning on it. The Dark Stone variant allows no entity to spawn on it.
guide.vampirism.blocks.garlic_beacon.text=Diffuses garlic particles into the air to prevent vampires from spawning and to weaken nearby vampires. The normal versions affects an area of %s by %s chunks from bedrock to sky around it, the improved one a %s by %s area. It's effect on vampires can be temporarily boosted by right-clicking it with %s. When boosted it even blinds nearby vampire players.
